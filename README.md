# Ising

This project is a 2D Monte Carlo simulation of a spin Ising model. Results are described in the <a href="https://github.com/zachglick/Ising/wiki">wiki section</a>.

Running the project requires some standard python libraries (matplotlib and numpy) and ImageMagick (for visualization). The tests described in the wiki can be performed by running the various `PartX.py` files. Alternatively, import the `Ising2D` class from `ising.py` to run your own calculation
